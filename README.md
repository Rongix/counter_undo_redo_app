# cubit_counter

A new Flutter project.
This is a basic counter app made using Bloc state management (Cubit). I wanted to try some out of the box features included in the library, mainly out of the box persistent stae and undo / redo capabilities. Even tho HydratedCubit uses Hive to save data, it feels a bit slower than vanilla Hive.
